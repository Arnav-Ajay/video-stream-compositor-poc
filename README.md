# Video Stream Compositor (FFmpeg PoC)

This repository contains a **proof-of-concept video stream compositor** built using **ffmpeg-python**.

The project was developed during an internship to explore how multiple video and audio streams could be synchronized and composited into a single output stream.

The original use case involved a **remote assistance system for industrial environments**, where technicians wearing smart glasses could stream video to remote subject-matter experts (SMEs). The system required the ability to combine multiple video feeds, overlays, and audio sources into a single synchronized output.

This prototype demonstrates how **multiple media inputs can be aligned using timing metadata and merged into a composite output video**.

# Overview

The system merges multiple media inputs by reading a session configuration from a JSON file and constructing a timeline-based composition.

Each input file specifies:

* start time
* duration
* whether audio/video components should be included
* how the media should be processed

The pipeline then:

1. Parses the session configuration
2. Extracts audio and video components
3. Aligns streams based on start times
4. Composes video overlays for each time interval
5. Mixes audio streams
6. Produces a final merged video output

# Requirements

Tested on:

* Elementary OS 5.1 Hera
* Python 3.6

Dependencies:

```
pip install ffmpeg-python
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
sudo apt-get install libavdevice57
```

---

# Running the Project

Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/Arnav-Ajay/ffmpeg.git
cd ffmpeg
```

Create the required directories:

```
mkdir files output temp
```

Place input media files in:

```
files/
```

Edit the session configuration:

```
data.json
```

Then run:

```
python3 main.py
```

The final merged video will be generated in:

```
output/
```

# Session Configuration (`data.json`)

Each session defines the set of media inputs and how they should be combined.

Example structure:

```json
{
  "session1": {
    "num_input": 4,
    "input_files": {
      "file1": {
        "filename": "LR1.mp4",
        "filepath": "./files/LR1.mp4",
        "filetype": "mp4",
        "start_time": 0,
        "duration": 240,
        "audio_c": true,
        "video_c": true,
        "flag": 0
      }
    },
    "duration": 306
  }
}
```

Key parameters:

| Field        | Description                             |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| `start_time` | Time offset (seconds) when media begins |
| `duration`   | Length of the media clip                |
| `audio_c`    | Include audio component                 |
| `video_c`    | Include video component                 |
| `flag`       | Controls how media is processed         |

Flag values:

```
0 → no change
1 → audio only
2 → video only
3 → skip file
```

# Status

This repository contains an **early proof-of-concept developed during an internship in 2020**.

The goal of the project was to validate the feasibility of synchronizing and compositing multiple video streams using FFmpeg.

The implementation focuses on demonstrating the core pipeline rather than providing a production-ready system.
